# Basic project to get started with learning to program in Python 3

## Get up and running
## Download Python3 and Pipenv (package manager)

1. Download and install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (3.10.6 is latest version at time of writing)
2. Once Python3 install has completed you should be able to open a windows command prompt (or linux terminal) and type 'python3 --version' and it should match the version you downloaded (mine says 3.10.6)
3. In the command prompt window type 'pip3 install pipenv'
4. Once step 3 has finished you should be able to type 'pipenv --version' and you will see a version message

## Download PyCharm Community
6. Download and install PyCharm **Community** (which is free) from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

## Clone py_prog github repo

7. Run PyCharm and at the first screen you see you should see an option to 'Get from VCS'
8. Click 'Get from VCS'
9. Select the 'Github' option in the left hand toolbar
10. Click 'Use Token' and a browser will open where you can log in to your Github account and then you can generate a Personal Access Token
11. On the New Personal Access Token page in your browser you can select an expiry for the token (pick 90 days) and then click Generate
12. Once the token appears make sure you copy it to the clipboard as you will only get to see it once
13. Return to PyCharm and you should now be able to Click Use token again and you will see a space to enter the token you copied from step 9
14. Paste in your token and this will log you in and show you the repositorties you can clone
15. Select the py_prog repo and click ok.. you can then select where py_prog is cloned to (I placed in a directory called pycharm inside my user folder
